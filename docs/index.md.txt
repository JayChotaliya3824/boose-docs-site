# BOOSE Interpreter Documentation

Welcome to the BOOSE Interpreter project documentation. This is a custom programming language interpreter built as part of Advanced Software Engineering coursework.

## Overview

The BOOSE Interpreter is a graphical programming language that allows users to create drawings through code commands. It features a complete parser, command execution system, and GUI interface.

## Key Features

- **Drawing Commands**: moveto, drawto, circle, rect, pencolour, write
- **Control Structures**: while loops, for loops, if-else conditionals
- **Variable Support**: integers, real numbers, arrays
- **Method Definitions**: Create and call custom methods with parameters
- **Expression Evaluation**: Mathematical expressions and variable operations
- **GUI Interface**: Form-based interface with program window, output window, and run button

## Architecture Highlights

The interpreter uses a central `ExecuteBlock` method to parse and execute BOOSE programs. It creates and runs `ICommand` objects through a `CommandFactory` using the **Singleton** and **Factory** design patterns.

### Core Components

- **Parser**: Reads BOOSE code line by line and creates command objects
- **CommandFactory**: Creates appropriate command objects (Factory Pattern)
- **ICommand Interface**: All commands implement this interface (Strategy Pattern)
- **ExpressionEvaluator**: Handles mathematical expressions and variable resolution
- **MethodDefinition**: Stores and manages custom method definitions

## Quick Start

1. Load a BOOSE program file or write code in the program window
2. Click the Run button to execute
3. View the output in the drawing canvas and output window

## Implementation Challenges

### Control Structures
Loops (while, for) were implemented by searching for block end markers (endwhile, endif) and recursively calling `ExecuteBlock` based on condition evaluation.

### Methods
The method system recognizes signatures (e.g., `method draw(p)`), saves lines to a `MethodDefinition` object, and creates new variable scopes when called. Proper parameter parsing was critical to avoid index-out-of-range errors.

### Expression Evaluation
A dedicated `ExpressionEvaluator` class handles expression resolution, separating concerns from the main parser logic.

## Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: `CommandFactory` creates command objects based on input
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures single instance of key components
- **Strategy Pattern**: `ICommand` interface allows extensible command system
- **Interface Segregation**: All commands implement `ICommand` for consistency
