    "summary": "BOOSE Interpreter Documentation Welcome to the BOOSE Interpreter project documentation. Overview The BOOSE Interpreter is the graphical programming language that allows users to create drawings through code commands. It has the features of a complete parser, command execution system, and GUI interface. Key Features Drawing Commands: moveto, drawto, circle, rect, pencolour, write Control Structures: while loops, for loops, if-else conditionals Variable Support: integers, real numbers, arrays Method Definitions: Create and call custom methods with parameters Expression Evaluation: Mathematical expressions and variable operations GUI Interface: Form-based interface with program window, output window, and run button Architecture Highlights The interpreter uses a central ExecuteBlock method to parse and execute BOOSE programs. It creates and runs ICommand objects through a CommandFactory using the Singleton and Factory design patterns. Core Components Parser: It reads the BOOSE code line by line and creates command objects CommandFactory: It creates the appropriate command objects (Factory Pattern) ICommand Interface: The all commands implement this interface (Strategy Pattern) ExpressionEvaluator: It handles the mathematical expressions and the variable resolution MethodDefinition: It stores and manages the custom method definitions Implementation Challenges Control Structures The loops (while, for) were implemented by searching for block end markers (endwhile, endif) and recursively calling the ExecuteBlock based on condition tested. Methods The method system recognizes the signatures (e.g., method draw(p)), saves lines to the MethodDefinition object, and then creates new variable scopes when called. The proper parameter parsing was critical to avoid index-out-of-bound errors. Expression Evaluation A dedicated ExpressionEvaluator class handles the expression resolution, separating the concerns from the main parser logic. Design Patterns Factory Pattern: CommandFactory creates the command objects based on user's input Singleton Pattern: It ensures single instance of the key components Strategy Pattern: ICommand interface allows the extensible command system Interface Segregation: The all commands implement ICommand for the consistency Repository GitHub Repository: ASE BOOSE Assignment Author Group 3 - Jay Chotaliya Advanced Software Engineering Course October 2025"
